***Add topic***

In "ADD TOPIC" section you can:
1. add new topic, new subtpics in this topic and words for this subtopic
2. add new subtopics in already existing topic
3. add new words in already existing subtopics

If you will write already exitsting topic name in "Topic" field, then subtopics will be added in this topic (without creating new topic with the same name)
The same things with subtopics. If written subtopic already exist in this topic, then words will be added in this subtopic.

It is important to follow the format of adding words:
- topic should be written in "Topic" field
- subtopics with words should be written in big field below
You can add more than one subtopics at the same time.
Subtopics and each "word-translate" should be written on new line.
Between word and translate should be written "=".

Example:
Topic: Nature
______________________________
|  animals
|  dog = собака
|  cat = кот
|  chicken = курица
|  cow = корова
|
|  trees
|  oak = дуб
|  pine = сосна(но это не точно)
|
|_____________________________

And this will create/add topic "Nature", two subtopics "animals" and "trees" in this topic, and words for this subtopics below.
